#Photographers Page
üéØ Objective
This project aims to build a dynamic web application featuring a Category Listing Page for photographers and a dedicated Photographer Profile Page. It serves as a practical demonstration of UI development, API fetching, client-side state management, advanced filtering, searching, and logic implementation in a modern web environment.

‚ú® Features
The application is divided into two main parts, each with distinct functionalities:

Part 1: Category Listing Page
This page provides a comprehensive overview of photographers, allowing users to discover and filter based on various criteria.

Photographer Cards (Grid View)
Each photographer is represented by an interactive card displaying essential information:

Photographer Name
Profile Picture
Location
Starting Price
Rating
Tags: (e.g., "Candid", "Outdoor", "Traditional", "Studio")
"View Profile" Button: Navigates to the individual photographer's profile page.
Advanced Filters (Sidebar or Drawer)
A robust filtering mechanism to refine search results dynamically:

Price Range Slider: Filter photographers by their starting price range.
Ratings: Select photographers with a minimum rating (e.g., 4+, 3+).
Styles (Checkboxes): Filter by photography styles such as Traditional, Candid, Studio, Outdoor, etc.
City Dropdown: Select photographers from specific cities (e.g., "Bengaluru").
Sorting Options:
Price: Low to High
Rating: High to Low
Recently Added: (Simulated using a unique ID or timestamp)
Filters update the displayed results instantly without a full page reload.
Search Bar (Top)
A prominent search bar enabling users to find photographers:

Supports searching by photographer name, location, or tags.
Implements a fuzzy search behavior for more flexible results.
Pagination or Infinite Scroll
Efficiently loads and displays a large number of photographers:

Part 2: Photographer Profile Page
Accessed by clicking "View Profile" from the listing page, this dedicated page offers an in-depth look at a single photographer.

Name & Bio: A comprehensive introduction to the photographer.
Styles & Tags: Reiteration of their photography specializations.
Price: Displays their starting price details.
Full Gallery: A visually appealing display of their work, implemented as a carousel or grid.
Reviews: A section showcasing client feedback, including:
Reviewer Name
Rating
Comment
Date of Review
‚ÄúSend Inquiry‚Äù Button: Triggers a modal or popup form for users to send a direct inquiry to the photographer.
üöÄ Technologies Used
HTML: Structuring the content and layout of all pages.
CSS: Styling the application for a modern, responsive, and visually appealing user interface.
JavaScript : Powering all dynamic functionalities, including API fetching, state management, filtering logic, search, pagination, and modal interactions.
Mock API (JSON Server): Used to create a simulated REST API, providing a flexible and realistic data source for development without requiring a full backend.
‚öôÔ∏è Installation
To set up and run this project locally, you will need Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

Clone the repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/abhinandan-debug/Photographers.git
Navigate into the project directory:

Bash

cd Photographers
Install JSON Server:
If you don't have JSON Server globally installed, install it:

Bash

npm install -g json-server
Prepare your Mock API Data:
Create a db.json file in your project's root directory (or a designated api folder) with your mock data structure for photographers and reviews.

Example db.json structure:
JSON

{
  "photographers": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "profilePicture": "https://placehold.co/150x150/FFF/000?text=Jane",
      "location": "Bengaluru",
      "startingPrice": 25000,
      "rating": 4.8,
      "tags": ["Candid", "Outdoor", "Maternity"],
      "bio": "Experienced maternity photographer...",
      "styles": ["Traditional", "Candid"],
      "gallery": [
        "https://placehold.co/600x400/FF0000/FFFFFF?text=Gallery+1",
        "https://placehold.co/600x400/00FF00/FFFFFF?text=Gallery+2"
      ],
      "reviews": [
        {
          "reviewer": "Client A",
          "rating": 5,
          "comment": "Amazing work!",
          "date": "2023-01-15"
        }
      ]
    }
    // ... more photographers
  ],
  "categories": [
      "Maternity",
      "Wedding",
      "Portrait"
  ]
}
(Note: You'll need to create your own db.json file with actual mock data for photographers and their profiles, galleries, and reviews. Ensure it matches the data points expected by your JavaScript logic.)

Start the Mock API Server:
Run JSON Server from your project's root directory (or where db.json is located):

Bash

json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
This will start your mock API on http://localhost:3000. Your JavaScript will fetch data from endpoints like http://localhost:3000/photographers.

Open the Application:
Simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Ensure the mock API server is running in the background for data to load correctly.

üí° Usage
Category Listing Page (index.html):
